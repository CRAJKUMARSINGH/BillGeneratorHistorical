                    ARCHIVE APPS - START HERE
================================================================================

EASIEST METHOD - Just 3 Steps:

1. Find this file: ARCHIVE_APPS.bat
   (It's in the same folder as this file)

2. Double-click ARCHIVE_APPS.bat

3. Press any key when it asks

That's it! Wait 5-10 minutes and you're done.

================================================================================

WHAT IT DOES:

✅ Copies 7 apps to: C:\Users\Rajkumar\Stream-Bill-Apps-ARCHIVED
✅ Keeps Stream-Bill-App_Main (the best one)
✅ Original folders stay (you delete them later if you want)
✅ Safe - you can restore anytime

================================================================================

AFTER ARCHIVING:

1. Test main app:
   cd C:\Users\Rajkumar\Stream-Bill-App_Main
   python scripts\test_pdf_generation_comprehensive.py

2. Use main app for 1 week

3. If everything works, delete original 7 folders
